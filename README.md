# snake

## Project Description
I built this game from scratch to practice the Javascript, CSS, and HTML skills I'm learning in the MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course. 
This game replicates the beloved game ["Snake"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)).
Players use the buttons on the screen or arrow buttons on their keyboard to move the snake. The objective is to eat the apples, while trying to avoid running into your own tail.

## How to Run
You can run this code locally by downloading all of the files here to a single directory. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to load the game.

## Roadmap: Planned Improvements
- [ ] Update "Top Scores" section of the page to display scores and names of top scorers
- [ ] Add levels to the game, with snake speed increasing at each level
- [ ] Replace "Game Over" alert banner with a modal
